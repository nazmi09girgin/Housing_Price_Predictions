# Housing_Price_Predictions
I've created this project to predict housing prices using a machine learning model. It encompasses data analysis, model training, and presenting the results. You can find more information about the data used and the modeling techniques in the Jupyter Notebook file.

In this project, I've used regression analysis. Regression is a machine learning method that explores and predicts how a dependent variable (housing prices) is related to independent variables (data features used in the project). I may have also evaluated specific regression algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or support vector regression (SVR) in the project.
